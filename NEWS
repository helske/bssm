bssm 1.1.6 (Release date: )
==============
   * Cleaned some codes and added lots of tests in line with pkgcheck tests.
   * Fixed a bug in EKF-based particle filter which returned filtered estimates 
     also in place of one-step ahead predictions.
   * Fixed a bug which caused an error in suggest_N for nlg_ssm.
   * Fixed a bug which caused incorrect sampling of smoothing distribution for 
     ar1_lg model when predicting past or when using simulation smoother.

     multivariate time series case.

     parameter when using (intermediate) Gaussian approximation.
   * Fixed sampling of negative binomial distribution in predict method, which 
     used std::negative_binomial which converts non-integer phi to integer. 
     Sampling now uses Gamma-Poisson mixture for simulation.


bssm 1.1.5 (Release date: 2021-06-14)
==============
   * Added explicit check for nsim > 0 in predict method as sample function 
     works with missing argument causing crypting warnings later.
   * Updated drownings data until 2019 and changed the temperature variable
     to an average over three stations.
   * Improved checks for observations and distributions in model building.

==============
   * Better documentation for SV model, and changed ordering of arguments to
     emphasise the recommended parameterization.

==============
   * Fixed PM-MCMC and DA-MCMC for SDE models and added an example to `ssm_sde`.
   * Fixed the state covariance estimates of IS-MCMC, approx-MCMC, and 
     Gaussian MCMC when output_type = "summary".
   * Fixed memory leaks due to uninitialized variables due to aborted particle 
     filter.

     models.
   * Removed dependency on R::lchoose for safer parallel code.
   * Added vignette for SDE models.
   * Updated citation information and streamlined the main vignette.
   
bssm 1.1.2 (Release date: 2021-02-08)
==============
   * Changed the definition of D in ssm_ulg and ssm_ung, functions now accept 
     D as scalar or vector as 
     was originally intended.
   * Fixed a segfault issue with parallel state sampling in general 
     ssm_ulg/mlg/ung/mng models caused by calls to R function inside parallel 
     region.

   * Fixed simulation smoother for multivariate Gaussian models.

bssm 1.1.0 (Release date: 2021-01-19)
==============
   
   * Added function `suggest_N` which can be used to choose 
     suitable number of particles for IS-MCMC.
   * Added function `post_correct` which can be used to update 
     previous approximate MCMC with IS-weights.
   * Gamma priors are now supported in easy-to-use models such as `bsm_lg`. 
   * The adaptation of the proposal distribution now continues also after the 
     burn-in by default. 
   * Changed default MCMC type to typically most efficient and robust IS2.
   * Renamed `nsim` argument to `particles` in most of the R functions (`nsim` 
     also works with a warning).
   * Fixed a bug with bsm models with covariates, where all standard deviation 
     parameters were fixed. This resulted error within MCMC algorithms.
   * Fixed a dimension drop bug in the predict method which caused error for 
     univariate models.
   * Fixed some docs and added more examples.

==============

  * Added an argument `future` for predict method which allows 
    predictions for current time points by supplying the original model 
    (e.g., for posterior predictive checks). 
    At the same time the argument name `future_model` was changed to `model`.
  * Fixed a bug in summary.mcmc_run which resulted error when 
    trying to obtain summary for states only.
  * Added a check for Kalman filter for a degenerate case where all 
    observational level and state level variances are zero.

    with `iter` and `burnin` arguments.
  * Improved documentation, added examples.
  * Added a vignette regarding psi-APF for non-linear models.
  
bssm 1.0.0 (Release date: 2020-06-09)
==============
Major update

  * Major changes for model definitions, now model updating and priors 
    can be defined via R functions (non-linear and SDE models still rely on 
    C++ snippets).
  * Added support for multivariate non-Gaussian models.
  * Added support for gamma distributions.
  * Added the function as.data.frame for mcmc output which converts the MCMC 
    samples to data.frame format for easier post-processing.
  * Added truncated normal prior.
  * Many argument names and model building functions have been changed for 
    clarity and consistency.
  * Major overhaul of C++ internals which can bring minor efficiency gains 
    and smaller installation size.
  * Allow zero as initial value for positive-constrained parameters of bsm 
    models.
  * Small changes to summary method which can now return also only summaries 
    of the states.

  * Fixed a bug in phi-APF for non-linear models.

    samples.

==============
  * Tweaked tests in order to pass MKL case at CRAN.

bssm 0.1.7 (Release date: 2019-03-19)
==============
  * Fixed a bug in EKF smoother which resulted wrong smoothed state estimates 
    in case of partially missing multivariate observations. Thanks for Santeri 
    Karppinen for spotting the bug. 
  * Added twisted SMC based simulation smoothing algorithm for Gaussian models, 
    as an alternative to Kalman smoother based simulation.
  
bssm 0.1.6-1 (Release date: 2018-11-20)

    methods for SDE and ng_ar1 models.

    log(1+theta) to log(theta).

==============
  * Fixed the Cholesky decomposition in filtering recursions of multivariate 
    models.
  * as_gssm now works for multivariate Gaussian models of KFAS as well.
  * Fixed several issues regarding partially missing observations in
    multivariate models.
  * Added the MASS package to Suggests as it is used in some unit tests.

bssm 0.1.4-1 (Release date: 2018-02-04)
==============
  * Fixed the use of uninitialized values in psi-filter from version 0.1.3.

bssm 0.1.4 (Release date: 2018-02-04)
==============
  * MCMC output can now be defined with argument `type`. Instead of returning 
    joint posterior samples, run_mcmc can now return only marginal samples of 
    theta, or summary statistics of the states.
  * Due to the above change, argument `sim_states` was removed from the 
    Gaussian MCMC methods.
  * MCMC functions are now less memory intensive, especially with 
    `type="theta"`.


bssm 0.1.3 (Release date: 2018-01-07)
==============
  * Streamlined the output of the print method for MCMC results.
  * Fixed major bugs in predict method which caused wrong values for the 
    prediction intervals.

    one step ahead to the future.
  
bssm 0.1.2 (Release date: 2017-11-21)
==============
  * API change for run_mcmc: All MCMC methods are now under the argument
    method, instead of having separate arguments for delayed acceptance and IS 
    schemes.
  * summary method for MCMC output now omits the computation of SE and ESS in 
    order to speed up the function.
  * Added new model class lgg_ssm, which is a linear-Gaussian model defined 
    directly via C++ like non-linear ssm_nlg models. This allows more flexible
    prior definitions and complex system matrix constructions.
  * Added another new model class, ssm_sde, which is a model with continuous 
    state dynamics defined as SDE. These too are defined via couple 
    simple C++ functions.
  * Added non-gaussian AR(1) model class.
  * Added argument nsim for predict method, which allows multiple draws per
    MCMC iteration.
  * The noise multiplier matrices H and R in ssm_nlg models can now depend on 
    states.
