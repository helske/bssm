\description{
Prints some basic summaries from the MCMC run by  \code{\link{run_mcmc}}.
}
\details{
In case of IS-corrected MCMC, the SE-IS is based only on importance sampling estimates, with weights 
corresponding to the block sizes of the jump chain multiplied by the 
importance correction weights (if IS-corrected method was used). These estimates
ignore the possible autocorrelations but provide a lower-bound for the asymptotic 
standard error.
