\title{Log-likelihood of a Non-Gaussian State Space Model}
\usage{
\method{logLik}{nongaussian}(
  object,
  particles,
  method = "psi",
  max_iter = 100,
  conv_tol = 1e-08,
  seed = sample(.Machine$integer.max, size = 1),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Model model.}

\item{particles}{Number of samples for particle filter or importance sampling. If 0, 
approximate log-likelihood based on the Gaussian approximation is returned.}

\item{method}{Sampling method, default is psi-auxiliary filter (\code{"psi"}), 
other choices are \code{"bsf"} bootstrap particle filter, and \code{"spdk"}, 
which uses the importance sampling approach by Shephard and Pitt (1997) and 
Durbin and Koopman (1997).}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations for Gaussian approximation algorithm.}

\item{conv_tol}{Tolerance parameter for the approximation algorithm.}

\item{seed}{Seed for the random number generator.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\description{
