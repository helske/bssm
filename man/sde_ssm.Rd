sde_ssm(
  y,
  drift,
  diffusion,
  ddiffusion,
  obs_pdf,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Observations as univariate time series (or vector) of length \eqn{n}.}

\item{drift, diffusion, ddiffusion}{An external pointers for the C++ functions which
define the drift, diffusion and derivative of diffusion functions of SDE.}

\item{obs_pdf}{An external pointer for the C++ function which
computes the observational log-density given the the states and parameter vector theta.}

\item{prior_pdf}{An external pointer for the C++ function which
computes the prior log-density given the parameter vector theta.}

\item{theta}{Parameter vector passed to all model functions.}

\item{x0}{Fixed initial value for SDE at time 0.}

\item{positive}{If \code{TRUE}, positivity constraint is
forced by \code{abs} in Millstein scheme.}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{sde_ssm}.
}
\description{
Constructs an object of class \code{sde_ssm} by defining the functions for
the drift, diffusion and derivative of diffusion terms of univariate SDE,
as well as the log-density of observation equation. We assume that the
observations are measured at integer times (missing values are allowed).
}
\details{
As in case of \code{nlg_ssm} models, these general models need a bit more effort from
the user, as you must provide the several small C++ snippets which define the
model structure. See SDE vignette for an example.
