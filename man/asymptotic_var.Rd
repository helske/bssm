\title{Asymptotic Variance of IS-type Estimators}
\usage{
asymptotic_var(x, w, method = "sokal")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of samples.}

\item{w}{Vector of weights. If missing, set to 1 (i.e. no weighting is
assumed).}

\item{method}{Method for computing the IACT. Default is \code{"sokal"},
other options are \code{ess_basic} and \code{ess_bulk} which use the
corresponding functions of the \code{posterior} package.}
}
\description{
The asymptotic variance MCMCSE^2 is based on Corollary 1
of Vihola et al. (2020) from weighted samples from IS-MCMC. The default
method is based on the integrated autocorrelation time (IACT) by Sokal (1997)
which seem to work well for reasonable problems, but it is also possible to
use the Geyer's method as implemented in \code{ess_basic} of the
\code{posterior} package, or the improved \code{ess_bulk} method of the same
package. These effective sample sizes (ESS) can be converted to MCMCSE^2 as
MCMCSE(x)^2 = (var(z) * iact(z) / c^2) / n where z = w*(x-)
}
\details{
(var(z) * iact(z) / estimate_c^2) / length(z)

var(x) / ESS = var(x) * IACT / n) where var(x) is the
variance of x based on n i.i.d.samples.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1)
n <- 1e4 
x <- numeric(n)
phi <- 0.7
for(t in 2:n) x[t] <- phi * x[t-1] + rnorm(1)
w <- rexp(n, 0.5 * exp(0.001 * x^2))
# different methods:
asymptotic_var(x, w, method = "sokal")
asymptotic_var(x, w, method = "ess_basic")
asymptotic_var(x, w, method = "ess_bulk")
