\usage{
ng_bsm(y, sd_level, sd_slope, sd_seasonal, sd_noise, distribution, phi,
  u = 1, beta, xreg = NULL, period = frequency(y), a1, P1,
  state_intercept)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector or a \code{\link{ts}} object of observations.}

\item{sd_level}{A fixed value or a prior for the standard error
of the noise in level equation. See \link[=uniform]{priors} for details.}

\item{sd_slope}{A fixed value or a prior for the standard error
of the noise in slope equation. See \link[=uniform]{priors} for details.
If missing, the slope term is omitted from the model.}

\item{sd_seasonal}{A fixed value or a prior for the standard error
of the noise in seasonal equation. See \link[=uniform]{priors} for details.
If missing, the seasonal component is omitted from the model.}

\item{sd_noise}{Prior for the standard error of the additional noise term.
See \link[=uniform]{priors} for details. If missing, no additional noise term is used.}

\item{distribution}{distribution of the observation. Possible choices are
\code{"poisson"}, \code{"binomial"}, \code{"negative binomial"}.}

\item{phi}{Additional parameter relating to the non-Gaussian distribution.
For Negative binomial distribution this is the dispersion term, and for other
distributions this is ignored.}

\item{u}{Constant parameter for non-Gaussian models. For Poisson and negative binomial distribution, this corresponds to the offset
term. For binomial, this is the number of trials.}

\item{beta}{Prior for the regression coefficients.}

\item{xreg}{Matrix containing covariates.}

\item{period}{Length of the seasonal component i.e. the number of
observations per season. Default is \code{frequency(y)}.}

\item{a1}{Prior means for the initial states (level, slope, seasonals).
Defaults to vector of zeros.}

\item{P1}{Prior covariance for the initial states (level, slope, seasonals).
Default is diagonal matrix with 1e5 on the diagonal.}

\item{state_intercept}{Intercept terms for state equation, given as a
m times n matrix.}

\description{
Constructs a non-Gaussian basic structural model with local level or
local trend component, a seasonal component, and regression component
(or subset of these components).
