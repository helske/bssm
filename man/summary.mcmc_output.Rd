\usage{
\method{summary}{mcmc_output}(
  object,
  return_se = FALSE,
  variable = "theta",
  probs = c(0.025, 0.975),
  times,
  states,
  method = "sokal",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Output from \code{run_mcmc}}

\item{return_se}{if \code{FALSE} (default), computation of standard
errors and effective sample sizes is omitted (as they can take considerable
time for models with large number of states and time points).}

\item{variable}{Are the summary statistics computed for either
\code{"theta"} (default), \code{"states"}, or \code{"both"}?}

\item{probs}{Numeric vector defining the quantiles of interest. Default is
\code{c(0.025, 0.975)}.}

\item{times}{Vector of indices. For states, for what time points the
summaries should be computed? Default is all, ignored if
\code{variable = "theta"}.}

\item{states}{Vector of indices. For what states the summaries should be
computed?. Default is all, ignored if
\code{variable = "theta"}.}

\item{method}{Method for computing integrated autocorrelation time. Default
is \code{"sokal"}, other option is \code{"geyer"}.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

\description{
This functions returns a data frame containing mean, standard deviations,
standard errors, and effective sample size estimates for parameters and
states.
}
\details{
For IS-MCMC two types of standard errors are reported.
SE-IS can be regarded as the square root of independent IS variance,
whereas SE corresponds to the square root of total asymptotic variance
(see Remark 3 of Vihola et al. (2020)).
