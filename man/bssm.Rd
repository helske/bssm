\title{Bayesian Inference of State Space Models}
\description{
This package contains functions for efficient Bayesian inference of state 
space models, where model is assumed to be either
* Exponential family state space models, where the state equation is linear 
  Gaussian, and the conditional observation density is either Gaussian, 
  Poisson, binomial, negative binomial or Gamma density. 
* Basic stochastic volatility model.
* General non-linear model with Gaussian noise terms.
* Model with continuous SDE dynamics. 
For formal definition of the currently supported models and methods, as 
well as some theory behind the IS-MCMC and \eqn{\psi}{psi}-APF, 
see Helske and Vihola (2021), Vihola, Helske, Franks (2020) and the package 
vignettes.
